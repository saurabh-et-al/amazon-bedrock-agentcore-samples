    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates **AgentCore Memory Branching** - a powerful capability that enables multiple specialized agents to maintain isolated memory contexts while sharing a common memory resource. This is essential for multi-agent systems, especially those using parallel execution patterns like Strands Agent Graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Memory Branching Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "In multi-agent systems, different agents often need to:\n",
    "- **Maintain separate conversation contexts** - Each agent focuses on its domain without interference\n",
    "- **Execute in parallel** - Multiple agents can work simultaneously without memory conflicts\n",
    "- **Share a common session** - All agents contribute to the same user session while keeping their contexts isolated\n",
    "- **Access relevant history** - Agents can retrieve their own past interactions without mixing contexts\n",
    "\n",
    "AgentCore Memory Branching solves these challenges by allowing multiple conversation branches within a single memory session, similar to Git branches for code.\n",

    "3. **Hotel Booking Assistant** (hotel_agent_memory branch) - Manages accommodation requests\n",
    "\n",
    "The coordinator can delegate to specialized agents that execute in parallel, with each maintaining its own conversation history through memory branching.\n",

    "### Understanding Memory Branching for Multi-Agent Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "The memory resource we've created supports **branching** - a critical feature for multi-agent architectures. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Single Memory Resource, Multiple Branches:**\n",
    "- All agents share the same `memory_id` and `session_id`\n",
    "- Each agent gets its own `branch_name` for isolated context\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Benefits for Multi-Agent Systems:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Context Isolation**: Each agent maintains its own conversation history without interference\n",
    "   - Flight agent only sees flight-related conversations\n",
    "   - Hotel agent only sees hotel-related conversations\n",
    "   - Coordinator sees the main orchestration flow\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Parallel Execution Safety**: Multiple agents can execute simultaneously\n",
    "   - No memory conflicts when agents run in parallel\n",
    "   - Each branch is independently accessible\n",
    "   - Critical for Strands Agent Graphs that support concurrent execution\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Clear Audit Trail**: Each agent's interactions are traceable\n",
    "   - Inspect what each agent discussed\n",
    "   - Debug agent-specific issues\n",
    "   - Understand the flow of multi-agent conversations"

    "\n",
    "The `ShortTermMemoryHook` class implements branch-aware memory management. This is the key component that enables memory branching in our multi-agent system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Branch Initialization**: Automatically creates branches for each agent\n",
    "   - Main branch for the coordinator agent\n",
    "   - Specialized branches (e.g., `flight_agent_memory`, `hotel_agent_memory`) for sub-agents\n",
    "   - Branches are forked from the main conversation timeline\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Branch-Specific Memory Retrieval**: Each agent loads only its own context\n",
    "   - `on_agent_initialized()` fetches conversation history from the agent's branch\n",
    "   - Prevents context pollution between agents\n",
    "   - Enables agents to maintain focused, domain-specific conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Branch-Specific Memory Storage**: Conversations are saved to the correct branch\n",
    "   - `on_message_added()` stores messages in the agent's designated branch\n",
    "   - Supports concurrent writes from parallel agent execution\n",
    "   - No race conditions or memory conflicts\n",

    "In this notebook, we've demonstrated **AgentCore Memory Branching** - a critical capability for building robust multi-agent systems with parallel execution:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Memory Branching Enables Parallel Execution**\n",
    "   - Multiple agents can execute simultaneously without memory conflicts\n",
    "   - Each agent maintains its own conversation context through branches\n",
    "   - Essential for Strands Agent Graphs and other parallel agent frameworks\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Context Isolation Improves Agent Performance**\n",
    "   - Specialized agents focus on their domain without interference\n",
    "   - No context pollution between agents\n",
    "   - Cleaner, more relevant conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Shared Session with Isolated Contexts**\n",
    "   - Single memory resource and session ID\n",
    "   - Multiple branches for different agents\n",
    "   - Efficient resource utilization\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture Pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Memory Resource (memory_id)\n",
    "  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Session (session_id)\n",
    "      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main branch ‚Üí Coordinator Agent\n",
    "      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ flight_agent_memory ‚Üí Flight Agent (can run in parallel)\n",
    "      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hotel_agent_memory ‚Üí Hotel Agent (can run in parallel)\n",
