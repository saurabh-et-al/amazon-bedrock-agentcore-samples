This example showcases an advanced memory feature: **conversation branching**, which allows agents to fork conversation history and explore alternative conversation paths while preserving the original conversation thread.\n",

    "### Scenario context\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll create a **Travel Planning System** that demonstrates memory branching:\n",
    "1. A **main branch** conversation where all the conversations are stored\n",
    "2. A **flight agent branch** that forks from the main conversation to explore flight options\n",
    "3. A **hotel agent branch** that forks from the main conversation to explore hotel options\n",
    "4. Both agents can access the shared conversation history from the main branch\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach demonstrates how memory branching enables:\n",
    "- **Parallel exploration**: Agents can explore \"what-if\" scenarios without affecting the main conversation\n",
    "- **Context preservation**: Branched conversations maintain access to the original conversation history\n",
    "- **Specialized workflows**: Each branch can follow its own conversation path while staying grounded in the original context\n",

    "\n",
    "The memory resource we've created supports **conversation branching**, which enables:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Shared Session, Multiple Branches**: All agents use the same `memory_id`, `actor_id`, and `session_id`, but different `branch_name` values\n",
    "2. **Context Inheritance**: When a branch is forked, it inherits the conversation history from the parent branch (usually \"main\")\n",
    "3. **Isolated Evolution**: After forking, each branch maintains its own independent conversation thread\n",
    "4. **Branch-Specific Retrieval**: Agents can retrieve memories from their specific branch\n",

    "### Key Features:\n",
    "1. **Branch Management**: Automatically creates and initializes conversation branches\n",
    "2. **Retrieve Memories**: Fetches conversation history from the specified branch\n",
    "3. **Save Memories**: Stores new conversations to the appropriate branch\n",
    "4. **Branch Forking**: Creates new branches from the main conversation thread\n",

    "- Each agent can specify a `branch_name` (defaults to \"main\")\n",
    "- Non-main branches are automatically forked from the main conversation\n",
    "- Branches inherit the conversation history up to the fork point\n",
    "- Each branch maintains its own independent conversation flow after forking\n",

    "In this notebook, we've demonstrated:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Memory Branching Fundamentals**: How to create and manage conversation branches in AgentCore Memory\n",
    "2. **Branch-Specific Agents**: How to implement specialized agents that operate on different memory branches\n",
    "3. **Automatic Branch Creation**: How branches are automatically forked from the main conversation when first used\n",
    "4. **Branch Persistence**: How each branch maintains its own independent conversation history\n",
    "5. **Context Inheritance**: How branched conversations inherit context from the main branch up to the fork point\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Benefits of Memory Branching:\n",
    "- **Isolation**: Each agent maintains its own conversation context without interfering with others\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Explore alternative conversation paths without affecting the main thread\n",
    "- **Organization**: Keep domain-specific conversations organized in separate branches\n",
    "- **Persistence**: Branch-specific memories persist across agent instances\n",
    "\n",
    "This memory branching architecture provides a powerful approach for building sophisticated multi-agent systems where different agents need to maintain separate but related conversation contexts."
