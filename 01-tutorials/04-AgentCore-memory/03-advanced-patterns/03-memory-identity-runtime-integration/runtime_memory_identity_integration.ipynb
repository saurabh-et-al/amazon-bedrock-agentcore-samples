    "# Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime and AgentCore Memory Agent with Identity isolation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to create your first memory-enabled agent with user isolation using AgentCore Runtime and AgentCore Memory. You'll build a simple \"Hello World\" conversational agent that remembers previous interactions within a session, enabling more natural and contextual conversations with users across interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory is a critical component for creating effective conversational agents, as it allows them to maintain context, recall user preferences, and provide consistent responses over time. Without memory, your agent would have to start from scratch with each interaction, leading to a disjointed user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation leverages Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Memory with user identity propagation to automatically partition memory based on authenticated user credentials, creating secure, isolated memory spaces for each individual user.\n",

    "## 3. Creating Your Memory-Enabled Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll build our memory-enabled agent using Strands Agents framework with custom hooks for memory integration. This agent will maintain conversation context by storing and retrieving messages from AgentCore Memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Why Memory Matters**: Sessions in AgentCore runtime expire after a certain time, which deletes the conversation context. By storing conversations in memory, we ensure previous information persists between sessions, creating a seamless experience for users even after long breaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent Capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Our agent will:\n",
    "1. Store each user and assistant message in memory automatically\n",
    "2. Retrieve past conversation history when continuing an existing session\n",
    "3. Maintain context across multiple interactions with the same user\n",
    "4. Isolate conversations between different users through user identity verification\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components of Our Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Memory Hook Provider\n",
    "Our custom hook provider implements:\n",
    "- `on_agent_initialized`: Triggered when the agent starts, retrieves conversation history from AgentCore Memory\n",
    "- `on_message_added`: Triggered when a new message is added to the conversation, stores it in AgentCore Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Agent Initialization\n",
    "The `initialize_agent` function:\n",
    "- Configures the memory hook with the correct region\n",
    "- Sets up the agent with proper state variables (memory_id, actor_id, session_id)\n",
    "- Configures the system prompt for the LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. User verification\n",
    "The `get_user_sub` function:\n",
    "- Verifies a Cognito access token against JWKS and returns the user's sub (unique ID).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Entry Point Handler\n",
    "The runtime_memory_agent function:\n",
    "- Parses input payload and extracts user message\n",
    "- Verifies user identity using JWT tokens from Cognito\n",
    "- Manages agent initialization and session tracking\n",
    "- Handles invocation of the agent with proper context\n",
    "- Returns formatted responses to the runtime environment\n",
    "\n",

    "## 4. Deploying to AgentCore Runtime\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll deploy our agent to Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime, a managed agent runtime environment that provides scalability and simplified operations. AgentCore Runtime handles the infrastructure complexity, allowing you to focus on your agent's logic rather than deployment concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional deployment methods that require manual server setup and management, AgentCore Runtime automatically packages your code into containers, deploys them to AWS infrastructure, and provides secure HTTPS endpoints for invocation. This approach ensures your agent can scale with demand and operate reliably in production environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Behind the Scenes\n",
    "\n",
    "When you deploy to AgentCore Runtime, several things happen automatically:\n",
    "1. Your code is packaged into a Docker container image\n",
    "2. The container image is pushed to Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)\n",
    "3. An AWS Lambda function or container service is provisioned to run your agent\n",
    "4. API Gateway endpoints are created for secure access\n",
    "5. IAM roles and permissions are configured for secure operation\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Need to Know\n",
    "\n",
    "- **AgentCore Runtime** packages your agent into a Docker container and deploys it to managed AWS infrastructure\n",
    "- **Environment Variables** will configure our agent:\n",
    "  - `MEMORY_ID`: The memory resource we created earlier\n",
    "  - `MODEL_ID`: Claude 3.5 Haiku model ID\n",
    "  - `AWS_REGION`: AWS region for deployment\n",
    "  - `COGNITO_USER_POOL`: The Cognito user pool for authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💡 **Tip**: The AgentCore starter toolkit handles all the complex deployment steps for us, including IAM roles, ECR repositories, and container builds.\n",

    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you've learned several important concepts for building memory-enabled agents with AgentCore:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Memory Integration**: How to use Amazon Bedrock Memory to store conversation history across sessions, enabling your agent to maintain context over time even when sessions expire.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Session Management**: How to use session IDs to organize conversations and retrieve relevant history when a user returns, creating a seamless experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **AgentCore Deployment**: How to deploy your agent to a production runtime environment that handles scaling, security, and infrastructure management automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Memory Hooks**: How to implement custom hooks that integrate with memory services, allowing you to store and retrieve conversation history at specific points in the agent lifecycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **User Identity and Privacy**: How to use authentication to ensure that each user's conversation history is private and isolated from other users.\n",
    "\n",
    "These concepts provide a foundation for building more complex agents with persistent memory and sophisticated conversation management capabilities."

    "## Congratulations!\n",

    "You've successfully built and deployed your first memory-enabled agent with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime, AgentCore Identity and AgentCore Memory! This agent demonstrates several important capabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Memory Persistence**: Your agent can remember previous conversations.\n",
    "2. **User Identity**: Your agent maintains separate conversation histories for different users\n",
    "3. **Managed Infrastructure**: Your agent runs on AWS-managed infrastructure, scaling automatically as needed\n",

    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you understand the basics, you can enhance your agent in several ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Add Tools**: Enhance your agent with tools like calculators, database connectors, or API calls to let it take actions beyond conversation\n",
    "2. **Improve Memory**: Implement more sophisticated memory strategies with long-term memory\n",
    "3. **Build a UI**: Create a web or mobile interface for your agent using frameworks like React, Flutter, or Swift\n",
    "4. **Add Business Logic**: Integrate your agent with business systems like CRMs, knowledge bases, or internal tools"
